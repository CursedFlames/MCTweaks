# No Increasing Repair Cost

Disables the increasing repair/enchant cost on items in anvils, meaning things will no longer be too expensive,
and repairing items instead of using mending is finally viable.

Specifically, the anvil cost will always be the same as if the item hasn't been enchanted/repaired before.
