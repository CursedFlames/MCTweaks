# Pale

Simple mod that makes rotten flesh inflict Pale, a status effect that causes damage in sunlight, instead of Hunger.

Eating more rotten flesh at once will inflict higher levels of Pale, inflicting damage at a faster rate.

Biomes that don't experience rain (for example, deserts) will inflict double sunlight damage.

This is a port of the Pale effect from (Iridescent)[https://github.com/elytra/Iridescent], a 1.12 mod.
Thanks to Kat (5B) for the status effect icon.
